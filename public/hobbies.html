    In the past, I have felt guilty for jumping from one interest to another, thinking that I lacked commitment or something bizarre like that.
    I have more recently come to love and appreciate the diversity I seem to be hungry for. This endless pursuit of the New and Exciting fills 
    my life with endless possibility and continuous learning. I am never bored because there is always something new that I'm up to.
    The list below is a great representation of the hobbies I have previously been into, but it is constantly changing. Ask me again in a month, and this list
    will look completely different. :)
    <ul style="padding-left: 80; padding-right: 80;">
        <li>Knitting</li>
        <li>Hiking</li>
        <li>Baking</li>
        <li>Rock Climbing</li>
        <li>Eating Chips</li>
        <li>Pool (Cues)</li>
        <li>Sewing</li>
        <li>Rollerblading</li>
        <li>DIY Projects (I built a tiny house)</li>
        <li>Learning Different Languages</li>
        <li>Traveling</li>
        <li>Picking up any and all toads because they're adorable.</li>

    </ul>
